# Implementation from scratch of diverse ML models

I like to learn about Machine Learning. And a way I find useful is to implement the algorithms from cero.
In this repository you will find the implementation from scratch of some ML models.

Currently available:
* Support Vector Machine
* Mixutre Models

TODO list:
* Decision Trees
* K-Means
* K-NN
* Linear Regression
